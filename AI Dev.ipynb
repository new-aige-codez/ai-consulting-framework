    "## Overview\n",
    "This framework uses an interactive, conversational approach to build comprehensive context for AI-powered software development. Each step empowers the AI to ask for the information it needs, ensuring a robust plan before coding begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Principle:** The AI will not proceed with a step until it has the necessary information. It will ask you clarifying questions based on your chosen path and the context you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Master Brief Approach:** All planning documents will be consolidated into a single `Project_Brief.md` file that serves as your project's single source of truth."

    "**Choose one path:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path A: The Sprinter (Minimum Viable Context)\n",
    "**Best for:** Simple projects, quick prototypes. The AI will only ask for essential information.\n",

    "### Path B: The Strategist (Standard Context)\n",
    "**Best for:** Most projects, small business apps. The AI will ask for detailed strategic and market information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path C: The Architect (Maximum Context)\n",
    "**Best for:** Complex projects, SaaS applications. The AI will ask for comprehensive technical, market, and strategic details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:** In each step, you will provide the AI with your current `Project_Brief.md`. The AI will analyze it and ask for any missing information required for that step, according to your chosen path. You will then provide the answers and run the prompt again."
