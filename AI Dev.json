    "## Overview\n",
    "This framework uses an interactive, conversational approach to build comprehensive context for AI-powered software development. Each step empowers the AI to ask for the information it needs, ensuring a robust plan before coding begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Principle:** The AI will not proceed with a step until it has the necessary information. It will ask you clarifying questions based on your chosen path and the context you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Master Brief Approach:** All planning documents will be consolidated into a single `Project_Brief.md` file that serves as your project's single source of truth."

    "**Best for:** Most projects, small business apps. The AI will ask for detailed strategic and market information.\n",

    "### Path C: The Architect (Maximum Context)\n",
    "**Best for:** Complex projects, SaaS applications. The AI will ask for comprehensive technical, market, and strategic details.\n",
