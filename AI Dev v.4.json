    "# AI-Powered Software Development Framework v.4 - Hybrid Framework Edition\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ö° Quick Start\n",
    "1. **Choose your path** in the table below (A = Fast, B = Balanced, C = Comprehensive)\n",
    "2. **Click the step numbers** in the table to jump to your steps\n",
    "3. **Use the colored buttons** at the end of each step to navigate\n",
    "4. **Stay in one chat session** for best results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "**üìñ First, read the README.md file included with this framework for complete setup instructions and detailed guidance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This framework uses an interactive, conversational approach with path-optimized workflows. Each path provides different levels of planning depth while maintaining quality control through structured iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Principle:** Human creativity drives direction, AI research provides depth, structured iteration with \"one ticket at a time\" implementation ensures quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** This framework creates functional MVPs with basic styling and structure. Advanced UI/UX design and visual polish are handled in separate workflows after functionality is proven and working.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target:** Moderate complexity web/mobile applications (weeks of development)\n",
    "**Focus:** Higher quality code, reduced AI confusion, MVP-first development\n",
    "\n",
    "**New in v.4:** Enhanced Path A with basic PRD creation using web research, updated document naming conventions, and integrated \"Vibe Architecting\" methodology with one-ticket-at-a-time implementation."

    "## üß≠ How to Use This Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîò Using the Button Navigation System (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework includes an intelligent navigation system designed for seamless workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Start Here:** Click any step number in the comparison table below to jump directly to that step\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Follow Your Path:** At the end of each step, click your path's colored button:\n",
    "- ÔøΩ **Yellow Button** = Path A (Sprinter)\n",
    "- üîµ **Blue Button** = Path B (Strategist)  \n",
    "- ÔøΩ **Green Button** = Path C (Architect)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Path Indicators:** Each step clearly shows **\"Paths: All (A, B & C)\"** or **\"Paths: ONLY B & C\"** so you know if you should use that step\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Stay in One Chat:** üéØ **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** - Complete your entire project in a single, long conversation with your AI assistant. This ensures:\n",
    "- Full context retention across all steps\n",
    "- Consistent decision-making\n",
    "- Better quality outputs\n",
    "- No need to re-explain previous decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìã Copy/Paste Method (Only When Necessary)\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚ö†Ô∏è Use this method ONLY when you must switch AI tools/models or start a new chat session.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use:**\n",
    "- Your current chat session becomes too long and unstable\n",
    "- You need to switch to a different AI model/tool\n",
    "- Technical issues force you to start over\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Use:**\n",
    "1. **Copy the System Prompt:** Copy the entire gray box (system prompt) from your current step\n",
    "2. **Paste to New Chat:** Start your new AI conversation by pasting the system prompt\n",
    "3. **Provide Context:** Upload or paste all documents you've created so far\n",
    "4. **Specify Your Path:** Tell the AI which path you're following (A, B, or C)\n",
    "5. **Continue:** Proceed with the step as normal\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**\n",
    "- You'll lose conversational context and may need to re-explain decisions\n",
    "- Quality may be lower due to missing context\n",
    "- The AI may ask clarifying questions you've already answered\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Try to complete your entire project in one continuous chat session for best results"
